# ballmovement:

*The HTML and JavaScript code you have provided will move a ball around the screen in a straight line, bouncing off the walls. The ball will start moving in the top left corner of the screen and will move at a speed of 10 pixels per frame. 
# Steps to Run the Project
*The HTML code creates a simple web page with a single element, a div element with the id ball. This element will be used to represent the ball on the screen
*The JavaScript code defines a function called move(). This function will be used to update the position of the ball on the screen.

*The move() function first checks if the ball is within the bounds of the screen. If it is, the function updates the ball's x and y position by adding the velocity to each position. The function then updates the ball's CSS top and left properties to reflect its new position.

*If the ball is outside of the bounds of the screen, the move() function resets the ball's position to the top left corner of the screen.

*The setInterval() function is used to call the move() function every 100 milliseconds. This will cause the ball to move smoothly across the screen.

# Future Improvements
This Project can be further enhanced by creating an animation like a boy bouncing the ball
